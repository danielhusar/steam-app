# Steam market app

> This is a node webkit app for the steam market for easier buy process. Its just basically me playing around with node webkit so I'm not going to support this when steam change their apis, use rather their official site to buy stuff. Its a single page node webkit desktop app powered by angular.

## Installation

You will have to compile the app by yourself, I'm not going to add here compiled app for any platform.
On real os all you need is [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), or windows follow the [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp#installation) requirements. 

Install all the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

Run the app with node webkit, there is a [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) task that can do it for you.
